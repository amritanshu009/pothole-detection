# Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

## Project Overview

This project is a pothole detection system built using YOLOv8, a deep learning-based object detection model. The main goal of this project is to detect potholes from road images and videos automatically.

Pothole detection is useful for road safety, smart city monitoring, traffic management, and road maintenance systems. Instead of manually checking road conditions, this system can help identify pothole-affected areas using computer vision.

## Features

- Detects potholes from road images
- Supports pothole detection in videos
- Uses YOLOv8 for object detection
- Includes trained model weights
- Contains training results and evaluation graphs
- Provides separate Python scripts for image and video prediction

Technologies Used
Python
YOLOv8
Ultralytics
OpenCV
PyTorch
YAML
Dataset

The dataset contains road images used for pothole detection. It includes normal road images, pothole images, training images, labels, and test videos.

The annotations are stored in YOLO format, where each label file contains bounding box details for pothole detection.

Model

This project uses YOLOv8 for object detection. YOLOv8 is suitable for real-time detection tasks because it provides good speed and accuracy.

The trained model weights are stored in:

runs/detect/train10/weights/

The important trained weight files are:

best.pt
last.pt
Training Results

The training results are available inside:

runs/detect/train10/

This folder includes:

Confusion matrix
Normalized confusion matrix
Precision curve
Recall curve
F1 score curve
Precision-Recall curve
Training result graph
Validation prediction images
Trained model weights
Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/amritanshu009/pothole-detection.git
cd pothole-detection

Install the required libraries:

pip install ultralytics opencv-python
How to Run
Run Image Detection
python pred.py
Run Video Detection
python pred_vid.py
Train the Custom YOLO Model
python yolo_custom.py
Expected Output

The model detects potholes in images or videos and marks them using bounding boxes. The output helps visually identify potholes on road surfaces.

Applications
Road damage detection
Smart city road monitoring
Automated road inspection
Vehicle safety systems
Public infrastructure maintenance
Traffic and transportation analysis
Future Improvements
Add real-time webcam pothole detection
Improve the dataset with more road conditions
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
Build a simple web interface for image and video upload
Add GPS location tracking for detected potholes
